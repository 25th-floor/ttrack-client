# About
This node_modules solves the problem of absolute path. 
For more infomration see https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1065

## example
```jsx 
import { Layout } from '../../../components'
// you can do
import { Layout } from '@components'
// the @ should signal that this package is local scoped
```

## ISSUES
 - node_modules ignored in .gitignore
 - watcher dont catch changes 
 - cant access nested folders only via exports
